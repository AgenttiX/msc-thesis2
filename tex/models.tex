\section{The bag model}
\label{bag_model}
The equation of state is the function $p(T)$ or $p(w)$ that characterises the behaviour of the fluid as a function of temperature $T$ or enthalpy $w$.
It should be highlighted that everything up to this point has been independent of the equation of state,
and we will now move forward to describing our first equation of state.

One of the simplest equations of state is the bag model, where
\cites[eq. 7.33]{lecture_notes}[eq. 8-9]{giese_2020}
\begin{align}
p_s &= a_s T^4 - V_s,
\label{eq:bag_ps} \\
p_b &= a_b T^4 - V_b,
\label{eq:bag_pb}
\end{align}
where $a_s$, $a_b$, $V_s$ and $V_b$ are positive constants with $a_s > a_b$ and $V_s > V_b$.
The subscripts $s$ refers to the symmetric phase, and $b$ to the broken phase.
The potential difference $V_s - V_b$ is the temperature-independent vacuum energy that is released in the phase transition.
In some articles it's denoted with $\epsilon$.
\todo{Add citation to Giese?}
The potentials are usually shifted so that $V_b = 0$.
The constants $a_s$ and $a_b$ are simplified from the relativistic degrees of freedom as
\begin{align}
a_s = \frac{\pi^2}{90} g_s, \\
a_b = \frac{\pi^2}{90} g_b.
\end{align}

Using \eqref{eq:energy_density} we get the energy density
\begin{align}
e_s &= 4 a_s T^4 + V_s, \\
e_b &= 4 a_b T^4 + V_b,
\end{align}
and with \eqref{eq:enthalpy_sum} the enthalpy density
\begin{align}
w_s &= 4 a_s T^4, \\
w_b &= 4 a_b T^4.
\end{align}

The speed of sound from \eqref{eq:cs2_explicit} simplifies to
\begin{equation}
c_s^2 = \frac{dp}{de} = \frac{dp/dT}{de/dT} = \frac{1}{3}.
\end{equation}
This corresponds to assuming both of the phases to be ultrarelativistic.
It also happens to be the same as the $\tilde{v}_-$ that corresponds to \eqref{eq:v_tilde_plus_limit}, and therefore the Chapman-Jouguet speed $v_{CJ}$ of the bag model is given by \eqref{eq:v_tilde_plus_limit}.

\begin{align}
\theta_s = V_s, \\
\theta_b = V_b,
\end{align}
and therefore the transition strength at nucleation temperature simplifies to
\begin{equation}
\alpha_n = \frac{4}{3 w_n} (V_s - V_b),
\label{eq:alpha_n_bag}
\end{equation}
which is trivial to invert, giving enthalpy at the nucleation temperature $w_n$.

The name of the bag model originates from quantum chromodynamics (QCD), where it's used to describe the proton as a bag of quarks.

\section{More complex models}
The bag model is a rather crude approximation, and for realistic simulations a more complex model is needed.
The primary parameters for these models are
\begin{itemize}
    \item The phase transition parameters: percolation temperature, phase transition duration
    \item Bubble wall velocity $v_w$
    \item Fraction of energy that is converted into fluid motion: $\kappa$
    \item Numerical prefactor from lattice simulations
\end{itemize}

Speed of sound may not be ultrarelativistic, especially in the broken phase.

\subsection{The constant sound speed model}
The constant sound speed model, also known as the $\mu, \nu$ model,
expands the bag model by allowing a different speed of sound in each phase.
\cites[eq. 15]{giese_2021}[eq. 38]{giese_2020}
\begin{align}
p_s &= a_s \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right)^{\mu-4} T^4 - V_s {\color{gray} \approx a_s T^\mu - V_s }, \\
p_b &= a_b \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right)^{\nu-4} T^4 - V_b {\color{gray} \approx a_b T^\nu - V_b}.
\end{align}
The reference temperature $T_0$ is introduce for the consistency of the units.
For simplicity it can be set to 1 GeV, or whichever unit one is using for the temperature.
The greyed-out versions are commonly seen in articles and useful, but have inconsistent units.
The parameters $\mu$ and $\nu$ are determined by the sound speeds in the symmetric and broken phases:
\cites[eq. 16]{giese_2021}[eq. 39]{giese_2020}
\footnote{Please note that there is a typo in \cite[eq. 15]{giese_2021}. There the 4 should be a $\mu$.}
\begin{align}
\mu = 1 + \frac{1}{c_{s,s}^2}, \\
\nu = 1 + \frac{1}{c_{s,b}^2}.
\end{align}
This model reduces to the bag model,
when $c_{s,s}^2 = c_{s,b}^2 = \frac{1}{3}$.

Similarly as for the bag model we can derive the energy density
\begin{align}
e_s &= (\mu - 1) a_s \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right)^{\mu-4} T^4 + V_s, \\
e_b &= (\nu - 1) a_b \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right)^{\mu-4} T^4 + V_b.
\end{align}
The enthalpy density is given by
\begin{align}
w_s &= \mu a_s \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right)^{\mu-4} T^4, \\
w_b &= \nu a_b \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right)^{\nu-4} T^4.
\end{align}
This can be inverted to give the temperature as a function of enthalpy
\begin{align}
T_s &= T_0 \left( \frac{w}{\mu a_s T_0^4} \right)^\frac{1}{\mu}, \\
T_b &= T_0 \left( \frac{w}{\nu a_s T_0^4} \right)^\frac{1}{\nu},
\end{align}
and the entropy density
\begin{align}
s_s &= \mu a_s \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right)^\frac{1}{\mu-1} T_0^3, \\
s_b &= \nu a_b \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right)^\frac{1}{\nu-1} T_0^3.
\end{align}
The trace anomaly of \eqref{eq:theta} simplifies to
\begin{align}
\theta_s(w) = \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{\mu} \right) w + V_s, \\
\theta_b(w) = \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{\nu} \right) w + V_b
\end{align}
With this the transition strength at nucleation temperature of \eqref{eq:alpha_n} simplifies to
\begin{equation}
\alpha_n = \frac{4}{3} \left( \frac{1}{\nu} - \frac{1}{\mu} + \frac{1}{w_n} (V_s - V_b) \right)
\end{equation}
Inverting this gives the enthalpy at the nucleation temperature
\begin{equation}
w_n = \frac{V_s - V_b}{ \frac{3}{4} \alpha_n + \frac{1}{\mu} - \frac{1}{\nu} }.
\end{equation}
\todo{Fix this in PTtools and check that these are correct}


\subsection{Model with cubic thermal effects}
Free energy
\todo{Where does this come from? How to extract the thermal effects?}
\cite[eq. 45]{giese_2020}
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\textsc{F}(\phi, T) =
&- \frac{a_+}{3} T^4 \\
&+ \lambda \left( \phi^4 - 2E\phi^3 T + \phi^2 \left( E^2 T_\text{cr}^2 + c \left( T^2 - T_\text{cr}^2 \right) \right) \right) \\
&+ \frac{\lambda}{4} \left( c - E^2 \right)^2 T_\text{cr}^4
\end{split}
\end{align}

The minimum of the field potential is given by
\cite[eq. 46]{giese_2020}
\begin{equation}
\phi_\text{min} = \frac{3}{4} ET + \sqrt{\frac{T^2}{2}(\frac{9}{8}E^2 - c) - \frac{T_\text{cr}^2}{2} (E^2 - c)}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Model with a two-step phase transition}
Two scalar fields and two symmetry breakings. Examples: electroweak symmetry, $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry.
Cubic term is neglected.
Pressures are of the form
\cite[eq. 47-48]{giese_2020}
\begin{align}
p_s(T) = \frac{1}{3}a_+ T^4 + (b_+ - c_+ T^2)^2 - b_-^2 \\
p_b(T) = \frac{1}{3}a_+ T^4 + (b_- - c_-T^2)^2 - b_-^2
\end{align}
Compare these to the \eqref{eq:bag_ps}, \eqref{eq:bag_pb}.


\section{Energy redistribution}
Efficiency factor $\kappa$, which is the fraction of energy that is converted into fluid motion.
\begin{equation}
\kappa = \frac{3}{\xi_w^3 \Delta \theta} \int d\xi \xi^2 w \gamma^2 v^2
\end{equation}
From solving the hydrodynamic equations of state of a single expanding bubble.

Kinetic energy fraction
\cites[eq. 7.36]{lecture_notes}[eq. 5]{giese_2020}
\begin{align}
K
&= \frac{\rho_\text{fl}}{\bar{e}}
&= \frac{1}{\mathcal{v} \bar{e}} \int d^3 x w \gamma^2 v^2,
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{v}$ is the volume we average over, and $\bar{e}$ is the mean energy density.
It should be noted that $0 < K < 1$.
\cite{giese_2020}

For a single bubble we have, using its volume and the energy density of the symmetric phase that the bubble replaces, the kinetic energy fraction
\cites[eq. 7.37]{lecture_notes}[eq. 5]{giese_2020}
\begin{equation}
K_1 = \frac{3}{\xi_w^3 e_s} \int d\xi \xi^2 w \gamma^2 v^2.
\end{equation}

The kinetic energy fraction can be determined from
\begin{itemize}
\item wall velocity $v_w$
\item the speeds of sound
\item strength parameter of the phase transition
\end{itemize}

Let us define the pseudotrace as
\cites[eq. 34]{giese_2020}[eq. 1]{giese_2021}
\begin{equation}
\overline{\theta} \equiv e - \frac{p}{c_{s,b}^2}.
\end{equation}

For detonations, the optimal phase transition strength is
\cites[eq. 34]{giese_2020}[eq. 1]{giese_2021}
\todo{Todo: Explain how this is defined}
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{\overline{\theta}} \equiv \frac{D \overline{\theta}(T_+)}{3w_+},
\end{equation}
