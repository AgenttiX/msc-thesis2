Equations of state
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bag model \cite[eq. 7.33]{hindmarsh_phase_2021}
    \item Assumptions on speed of sound and constant parameters
    \item Giese's paper \cite{giese_model-independent_2020}
    \item Enqvist, old paper \cite{enqvist_nucleation_1992}
\end{itemize}

Employment?
- "things that need to be done"
-> suitable for public dissemination
- write some short description,
    - ArXiv paper

2 papers by Giese, second one is more complete
Paper 1 \cite{giese_model-independent_2020}
Paper 2 \cite{giese_model-independent_2021}

TODO: understand these
\begin{itemize}
    \item Relativistic hydrodynamics from the review article (aka. lecture notes) \cite{hindmarsh_phase_2021}
    \item Reviews from other people (not just Hindmarsh)
    \item Article by Mazumdar \& White, especially section 7: relativistic combustion \cite{mazumdar_review_2019}
    \item The sound shell model paper
    \item Really understand what's going on! Compute with pen \& paper etc.
    \item Relativistic hydrodynamics
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The book by Luciano Rezzolla \& Olindo Zanotti \cite{rezzolla_relativistic_2013}
        \item Read the part I (some 300 pages at first)
        \item Contains more than necessary for the thesis
    \end{itemize}
    \item The phase transition section should have plenty of content before Christmas
    \item Enqvist's paper
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Good background: connects the equations of state to particle physics
        \item -> What kinds of equations of state would a particle theory produce
        \item Assumes ultrarelativisticity, which is no longer necessary due to the improvement of computational tools
    \end{itemize}
    \item Ultimately the equation of state can be derived from the "Thermal effective potential".
    \item Chemical potential is zero, as there is no conserved particle number.
    \item J-function, fB, lecture eq. 2.19 etc.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item These will be our first equation of state.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
