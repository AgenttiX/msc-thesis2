\section{Basics}
Electroweak symmetry breaking at $10^{-11}$ s, $100$ -- $1000$ GeV.
First-order phase transition
-> bubbles just below the critical temperature
-> gravitational waves

Standard model has a crossover, but many extensions first-order.

Matter-antimatter asymmetry -> net baryon number
(But isn't B an accidental symmetry, whereas B-L is a fundamental one?
How does this correspond to the neutrino content of the universe?)
\cite{lecture_notes}

The gravitational wave spectrum can be calculated from a few thermodynamic properties of ultrarelativistic matter, which can be computed from quantum field theory.
These parameters can be measured by LISA.

\section{Relativistic hydrodynamics}
Statistical mechanics \cite{huang_statistical_1987}
\cite{schroeder_thermal_2000}
\cite[ch. 4]{lecture_notes}
% According to Hindmarsh it's OK to have references on the level of individual chapters and equations.

Let us start from the very basics of thermal physics.
The
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausius\%E2\%80\%93Clapeyron_relation}{Clausius-Clapeyron relation}
% According to Hindmarsh it's OK to have hyperlinks to unofficial sources such as Wikipedia.
\cite[eq. 5.47, 5.48]{schroeder_thermal_2000}
\begin{equation}
\frac{dp}{dT} = \frac{L}{T \Delta V} = \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta V},
\end{equation}
when taken to the differential limit, gives the entropy density
\todo{Read the book on relativistic hydrodynamics for a proper derivation}
\cite[p. 23]{lecture_notes}
\begin{equation}
s \equiv \frac{dp}{dT}.
\end{equation}
This can be inserted in the thermodynamic identity
\cite[eq. 3.46]{schroeder_thermal_2000}
\begin{equation}
dU = TdS - pdV
\end{equation}
to get the energy density
\begin{equation}
e \equiv T \frac{\partial p}{\partial T} - p.
\end{equation}
This in turn can be inserted to the definition of enthalpy
\cite[eq. 1.51]{schroeder_thermal_2000}
\begin{equation}
H \equiv E + pV
\end{equation}
to get the enthalpy density
\begin{align}
w
&\equiv T \frac{\partial p}{\partial T} \\
&= e+p \\
&= Ts.
\end{align}
Additionally we need to define the entropy current as
\cite[p. 23]{lecture_notes}
\begin{equation}
S^\mu \equiv su^\mu
\end{equation}
It should be noted that the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation}{Einstein notation} will be used for the indices throughout the thesis.
% The Einstein notation is absolute basics for theoretical physicists, but unfortunately the study programme of many of my applied/technical physicists friends doesn't involve it, so I'm mentioning it explicitly here so that they can google it.

Since our system of interest is composed of ultrarelativistic particles,
and the number of particles is not constant, as the particles are annihilated an new ones are formed all the time,
we need to analyze the behaviour of the system as a fluid within general relativity.
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress\%E2\%80\%93energy\_tensor\#Stress\%E2\%80\%93energy\_of\_a\_fluid\_in\_equilibrium}{
In general relativity the hydrodynamic behaviour of a fluid is defined by the energy-momentum tensor, also known as the stress-energy tensor.}
\todo{Should I introduce the reader to the basics of a stress-energy tensor here? At least I wasn't familiar with the concept beforehand.}
\href{https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/412067/298623}{In these models we are assuming a perfect fluid in thermodynamic equilibrium.}
As the fluid is in thermodynamic equilibrium, there is no energy transfer to or from the fluid.
Therefore
$\forall j=1,2,3: \quad T^{0j} = 0$.
As the fluid has no viscosity, it does not experience any shear stress, and therefore
$\forall i,j=1,2,3, \quad i \neq j: \quad T^{ij} = 0$.
This does not depend on the reference frame, so the tensor is diagonal in all reference frames.
Therefore $T^{ij} = p \delta^{ij}$.
These are satisfied only by the tensor $T^{00}=e, T^{jj}=p, \forall i \neq j T^{ij}=0$.
This can be broken in two components as
\todo{Derive this properly when taking reading the hydrodynamics book \cite{rezzolla_relativistic_2013} or taking the GR course.}
\todo{The specifics of the energy-momentum tensor will vary by the model,
so highlight how this affects the rest of the equations. Todo: derive this from the fluid equations.}
\cites[eq. 5.11, 5.23]{lecture_notes}[eq. 3]{giese_2020}[eq. 4]{giese_2021}
\begin{align}
T^{\mu \nu}_f
&= (e+p) u^\mu u^\nu + p g^{\mu \nu}
\label{eq:ep_tensor} \\
&= w u^\mu u^\nu + p g^{\mu \nu}
\end{align}


\section{Field-fluid system}
Based on \cite{moore_pt_1995}.

In the electroweak phase transition the fluid is coupled to a scalar field with the energy-momentum tensor
\cites[eq. 2.9]{hindmarsh_gw_pt_2019}
\begin{equation}
T_\phi^{\mu \nu}
= \partial^\mu \partial^\nu \phi
- g^{\mu \nu} \left(\frac{1}{2} (\partial \phi)^2 + V_0 (\phi) \right)
\end{equation}

The total energy-momentum is conserved,
\cite[eq. 5.17]{lecture_notes}
\begin{equation}
\partial_\mu (T_f^{\mu \nu} + T_\phi^{\mu \nu}) = 0.
\label{eq:ep_conservation}
\end{equation}


\section{Relativistic combustion}
This chapter of the lecture notes is largely based on the references
% According to Hindmarsh, abbreviating "references" as "refs" is OK in the thesis.
\cites{hindmarsh_gw_pt_2019}{espinosa_energy_2010}.
\todo{Add more content from \cite[ch. 6]{mazumdar_review_2019}.}

The conservation of the energy-momentum of equation \ref{eq:ep_tensor} results in the bubble wall junction conditions
\cites[eq. 7.22]{lecture_notes}[eq. B.2-3]{hindmarsh_gw_pt_2019}
\begin{align}
w_- \tilde{\gamma}_-^2 \tilde{v}_- &= w_+ \tilde{\gamma}_+^2 \tilde{v}_+, \\
w_- \tilde{\gamma}_-^2 \tilde{v}_-^2 + p_- &= w_+ \tilde{\gamma}_+^2 \tilde{v}_+^2 + p_+
\end{align}
The first one is derived by TODO.
\todo{Todo: Derive the first equation}
The second one is derived by multiplying the conservation equation with $g^{\mu \nu}$. 

The bubble wall junction conditions can be rearranged as
\cites[eq. 7.32]{lecture_notes}[eq. 6-7]{giese_2020}
\begin{align}
\tilde{v_+} \tilde{v_-} = \frac{p_+ - p_-}{e_+ - e_-} \\
\frac{\tilde{v}_+}{\tilde{v}_-} = \frac{e_- + p_+}{e_+ + p_-}
\end{align}
And simplified to
\begin{align}
\frac{v_+}{v_-} &= \frac{1 - \frac{\Delta e}{w_+}}{1 - \frac{\Delta p}{w+}} \\
v_+ v_- &= \frac{\frac{\Delta p}{w_+}}{\frac{\Delta e}{w_+}}
\end{align}

Speed of sound
\cites[eq. 13]{giese_2020}[eq. 3]{giese_2021}
\begin{align}
c_s^2
&\equiv \frac{dp}{de} \\
&= \frac{dp/dT}{de/dT}
\end{align}
For a relativistic plasma $c_s^2=\frac{1}{3}$.

The trace of the energy-momentum tensor of equation \ref{eq:ep_tensor} is
\begin{align}
\text{tr} (T^{\mu \nu})
&= T^\mu_\mu \\
&= g_{\mu \nu} T^{\mu \nu} \\
&=3p - e
\end{align}
We can quantify the deviation from this with the trace anomaly
\cites[eq. 7.24]{lecture_notes}[eq. 28]{giese_2020}
\begin{equation}
\theta = \frac{1}{4}(e-3p).
\end{equation}
Please note that the definition of the trace anomaly varies by a factor of $\frac{1}{4}$ depending on the source as a matter of convention.

Difference of trace anomaly
\begin{align}
\Delta \theta
&\equiv \theta_+ - \theta_- \\
&= \theta_s - \theta_b
\end{align}

Transition strength
\begin{equation}
\alpha_+ = \frac{4 \Delta \theta}{3 w_+}
\end{equation}

Enthalpy ratio
\begin{equation}
r = \frac{w_+}{w_-}
\end{equation}

We can obtain useful continuity equations from the conservation of energy-momentum.
We start by defining two vectors, the fluid 4-velocity
\begin{equation}
u^\mu = \gamma(-1, \overrightarrow{v})^\mu
\end{equation}
and its orthonormal vector
\begin{equation}
\bar{u}^\mu = \gamma(-v, \frac{\overrightarrow{v}}{v})^\mu.
\end{equation}
These form an orthonormal basis.
It should be noted, that for orthonormal vectors
\begin{align}
% Note that the lecture notes use ubar here.
u_\mu u^\mu &= -1, \\
u_\mu \bar{u}^\mu &= 0.
\end{align}
By projecting the conservation equation to this basis we get
\begin{align}
0 = u_\mu \partial_\nu T^{\mu \nu} = -\partial_\mu (w u^\mu) + u^\mu \partial_\mu p \\
0 = \bar{u} \partial_\nu T^{\mu \nu} = w \bar{u}^\nu u^\mu \partial_\mu u_\nu + \bar{u}^\mu \partial_\mu p
\end{align}

Dimensionless coordinate
\begin{equation}
\xi = \frac{r}{t}
\end{equation}

Hydrodynamic equations, aka. continuity equations
\todo{Todo: Derive these}
\cites[eq. 7.30-7.31]{lecture_notes}[eq. 5]{giese_2021}
\begin{align}
\frac{dv}{d\xi} &= \frac{2v(1-v^2)}{\xi(1-v\xi)} \left( \frac{\mu(\xi,v)^2}{c_s^2} - 1 \right)^{-1} \\
\frac{dw}{d\xi} &= w \left( 1 + \frac{1}{c_s^2} \right) \gamma^2 \mu(\xi,v) \frac{dv}{d\xi}
\end{align}


\section{The bag model}
The bag model is the simplest model for the equation of state.
\todo{Find references to confirm this.}

In general, the speed of sound is temperature-dependent.
However, if both phases are assumed to be ultrarelativistic, the speed of sound simplifies to $c_s^2 = \frac{dp}{de} = 1/3$.
This is satisfied by the "bag" model, where
\cites[eq. 7.33]{lecture_notes}[eq. 8-9]{giese_2020}
\begin{align}
p_s &= a_s T^4 - V_s
\label{eq:bag_ps} \\
p_b &= a_b T^4,
\label{eq:bag_pb}
\end{align}
where $a_s$, $a_b$ and $V_s$ are positive constants with $a_s > a_b$.
s=symmetric, b=broken.


\section{More complex models}
The bag model includes severe approximations, and for realistic simulations a more complex model is needed.
The primary parameters for these models are
\begin{itemize}
    \item The phase transition parameters: percolation temperature, phase transition duration
    \item Bubble wall velocity
    \item Fraction of energy that is converted into fluid motion: $\kappa$
    \item Numerical prefactor from lattice simulations
\end{itemize}

Speed of sound may not be ultrarelativistic, especially in the broken phase.

\subsection{The $\mu,\nu$-model}
The $\nu$ model expands the bag model by allowing a change in the speed of sound of the broken phase.
\cites[eq. 15]{giese_2021}[eq. 38]{giese_2020}
\begin{align}
p_s &= \frac{1}{3} a_+ T^\mu - \epsilon \\
p_b &= \frac{1}{3} a_- T^\nu \\
e_s &= a_+ T^\mu + \epsilon \\
e_b &= \frac{1}{3} a_- (\nu - 1) T^\nu
\end{align}
The parameters $a_+$ and $a_-$ are proportional to the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the symmetric and broken phases, and $\epsilon$ is the temperature-independent vacuum energy that is released in the phase transition.
The parameters $\mu$ and $\nu$ are determined by the sound speeds in the symmetric and broken phases:
\cites[eq. 16]{giese_2021}[eq. 39]{giese_2020}
\begin{align}
\mu = 1 + \frac{1}{c_{s,s}^2}, \\
\nu = 1 + \frac{1}{c_{s,b}^2}.
\end{align}
\footnote{Please note that there is a typo in \cite[eq. 15]{giese_2021}. There the 4 should be a $\mu$.}

\subsection{Model with cubic thermal effects}
Free energy
\todo{Where does this come from? How to extract the thermal effects?}
\cite[eq. 45]{giese_2020}
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\textsc{F}(\phi, T) =
&- \frac{a_+}{3} T^4 \\
&+ \lambda \left( \phi^4 - 2E\phi^3 T + \phi^2 \left( E^2 T_\text{cr}^2 + c \left( T^2 - T_\text{cr}^2 \right) \right) \right) \\
&+ \frac{\lambda}{4} \left( c - E^2 \right)^2 T_\text{cr}^4
\end{split}
\end{align}

The minimum of the field potential is given by
\cite[eq. 46]{giese_2020}
\begin{equation}
\phi_\text{min} = \frac{3}{4} ET + \sqrt{\frac{T^2}{2}(\frac{9}{8}E^2 - c) - \frac{T_\text{cr}^2}{2} (E^2 - c)}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Model with a two-step phase transition}
Two scalar fields and two symmetry breakings. Examples: electroweak symmetry, $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry.
Cubic term is neglected.
Pressures are of the form
\cite[eq. 47-48]{giese_2020}
\begin{align}
p_s(T) = \frac{1}{3}a_+ T^4 + (b_+ - c_+ T^2)^2 - b_-^2 \\
p_b(T) = \frac{1}{3}a_+ T^4 + (b_- - c_-T^2)^2 - b_-^2
\end{align}
Compare these to the equations \ref{eq:bag_ps}, \ref{eq:bag_pb}.



\section{Types of solutions}

Subsonic deflagrations

Detonations

Supersonic deflagrations (hybrids)


\section{Energy redistribution}
Efficiency factor $\kappa$, which is the fraction of energy that is converted into fluid motion.
\begin{equation}
\kappa = \frac{3}{\xi_w^3 \Delta \theta} \int d\xi \xi^2 w \gamma^2 v^2
\end{equation}
From solving the hydrodynamic equations of state of a single expanding bubble.

Kinetic energy fraction
\cites[eq. 7.36]{lecture_notes}[eq. 5]{giese_2020}
\begin{align}
K
&= \frac{\rho_\text{fl}}{\bar{e}}
&= \frac{1}{\mathcal{v} \bar{e}} \int d^3 x w \gamma^2 v^2,
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{v}$ is the volume we average over, and $\bar{e}$ is the mean energy density.
It should be noted that $0 < K < 1$.
\cite{giese_2020}

For a single bubble we have, using its volume and the energy density of the symmetric phase that the bubble replaces, the kinetic energy fraction
\cites[eq. 7.37]{lecture_notes}[eq. 5]{giese_2020}
\begin{equation}
K_1 = \frac{3}{\xi_w^3 e_s} \int d\xi \xi^2 w \gamma^2 v^2.
\end{equation}

The kinetic energy fraction can be determined from
\begin{itemize}
\item wall velocity $v_w$
\item the speeds of sound
\item strength parameter of the phase transition
\end{itemize}

Let us define the pseudotrace as
\cites[eq. 34]{giese_2020}[eq. 1]{giese_2021}
\begin{equation}
\overline{\theta} \equiv e - \frac{p}{c_{s,b}^2}.
\end{equation}

For detonations, the optimal phase transition strength is
\cites[eq. 34]{giese_2020}[eq. 1]{giese_2021}
\todo{Todo: Explain how this is defined}
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{\overline{\theta}} \equiv \frac{D \overline{\theta}(T_+)}{3w_+},
\end{equation}
