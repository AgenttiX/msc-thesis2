\section{Basics}
Electroweak symmetry breaking at $10^{-11}$ s, $100$ -- $1000$ GeV.
First-order phase transition
-> bubbles just below the critical temperature
-> gravitational waves

Standard model has a crossover, but many extensions first-order.

Matter-antimatter asymmetry -> net baryon number
(But isn't B an accidental symmetry, whereas B-L is a fundamental one?
How does this correspond to the neutrino content of the universe?)
\cite{lecture_notes}

The gravitational wave spectrum can be calculated from a few thermodynamic properties of ultrarelativistic matter, which can be computed from quantum field theory.
These parameters can be measured by LISA.

% Statistical mechanics \cite{huang_statistical_1987}
% \cite{schroeder_thermal_2000}

% According to Hindmarsh it's OK to have references on the level of individual chapters and equations.

\iffalse
The
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausius\%E2\%80\%93Clapeyron_relation}{Clausius-Clapeyron relation} states that
% According to Hindmarsh it's OK to have hyperlinks to unofficial sources such as Wikipedia.
\cite[eq. 5.47, 5.48]{schroeder_thermal_2000}
\begin{equation}
\frac{dp}{dT} = \frac{L}{T \Delta V} = \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta V}.
\end{equation}
\fi

Let us start from the thermodynamic identity of classical thermal physics
\cites[eq. 2.136]{rezzolla_relativistic_2013}[eq. 3.68]{schroeder_thermal_2000}
\begin{equation}
dU = TdS - pdV + \mu dN,
\end{equation}
where $U$ is internal energy, $T$ is temperature, $p$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, $\mu$ is chemical potential and $N$ is the number of particles.
The fluids in our case are ultrarelativistic, and therefore effectively $T >> \mu$,
and we can neglect $dN$.
Perturbing around a constant $U$ (effectively setting $dU=0$) gives the entropy density
\todo{Is this the correct explanation?}
\cite[p. 23]{lecture_notes}
\begin{equation}
s \equiv \frac{dS}{dV} = \frac{dp}{dT}.
\end{equation}
Inserting this back to the thermodynamic identity gives the \textbf{energy density}
\begin{equation}
e \equiv \frac{dU}{dV} = T \frac{\partial p}{\partial T} - p.
\end{equation}
This in turn can be inserted to the definition of enthalpy
\cite[eq. 1.51]{schroeder_thermal_2000}
\begin{equation}
H \equiv E + pV
\end{equation}
to get the \textbf{enthalpy density}
\begin{align}
w
&\equiv \frac{dH}{dV} \\
&= e+p \\
&= T \frac{\partial p}{\partial T} \\
&= Ts.
\end{align}
Additionally we need to define the \textbf{specific enthalpy} \cite[eq. 2.141]{rezzolla_relativistic_2013}
\begin{equation}
h = \frac{e+p}{\rho},
\label{eq:specific_enthalpy}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the rest-mass density, and the \textbf{entropy current}
% Rest-mass density is defined in eq. 2.123
\cite[p. 23]{lecture_notes}
\begin{equation}
S^\mu \equiv su^\mu,
\end{equation}
as we will need these later.
It should be noted that the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation}{Einstein notation} will be used for the indices throughout the thesis.
Greek indices are used for four-vectors and latin indices for three-vectors.
% The Einstein notation is absolute basics for theoretical physicists, but unfortunately the study programme of many of my applied/technical physicists friends doesn't involve it, so I'm mentioning it explicitly here so that they can google it.

Since our system of interest is composed of ultrarelativistic particles,
and the number of particles is not constant, as the particles are annihilated an new ones are formed all the time,
we need to analyze the behaviour of the system as a fluid that obeys general relativity.
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress\%E2\%80\%93energy\_tensor\#Stress\%E2\%80\%93energy\_of\_a\_fluid\_in\_equilibrium}{
In general relativity matter and energy content of space is described by the \textbf{energy-momentum tensor} $T^{\mu \nu}$, also known as the stress-energy tensor.}
In Minkowski space in Cartesian coordinates it's given as
\cites[eq. 4.17]{rasanen_gr_2022}[fig. 3.3]{rezzolla_relativistic_2013}
\begin{equation}
T_{\mu \nu} =
\begin{bmatrix}
e & -q_1 & -q_2 & -q_3 \\
-q_1 & p + \Pi_{11} & \Pi_{12} & \Pi_{13} \\
-q_2 & \Pi_{12} & p + \Pi_{22} & \Pi_{23} \\
-q_3 & \Pi_{13} & \Pi_{23} & p + \Pi_{33}
\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
where $q$ is the energy flux or momentum density and $\Pi_{\mu \nu}$ is known as the anisotropic stress, anisotropic pressure or momentum flux.
\href{https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/412067/298623}{In our case we assume the energy-matter content to be an ideal fluid in thermal equilibrium.}
Therefore there is no energy transfer to or from the fluid.
Therefore
$\forall j=1,2,3: \quad T^{0j} = 0$.
As the fluid has no viscosity, it does not experience any shear stress, and therefore
$\forall i,j=1,2,3, \quad i \neq j: \quad T^{ij} = 0$.
This does not depend on the reference frame, so the tensor is diagonal in all reference frames.
Therefore $T^{ij} = p \delta^{ij}$.
These are satisfied only by the tensor $T^{00}=e, T^{jj}=p, \forall i \neq j: T^{ij}=0$.
This can be broken in two components as
\cites[eq. 5.11, 5.23]{lecture_notes}[eq. 4.12]{rasanen_gr_2022}
% [eq. 3]{giese_2020}[eq. 4]{giese_2021}
\begin{align}
T^{\mu \nu}_f
&= (e+p) u^\mu u^\nu + p g^{\mu \nu}
\label{eq:ep_tensor} \\
&= w u^\mu u^\nu + p g^{\mu \nu}.
\end{align}

We are assuming the background space-time to be constant, and therefore the total \textbf{energy-momentum is conserved}.
In the language of general relativity this is
\begin{equation}
\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu} = 0.
\label{eq:ep_conservation}
\end{equation}
Here $\nabla_\mu$ is the covariant derivative, which in Minkowki space in Cartesian coordinates reduces to the partial derivative $\partial_\mu$.
To expand this equation in a way consistent with \cite[ch. 3.3]{rezzolla_relativistic_2013} we need to define the projection tensor
\cite[eq. 3.9]{rezzolla_relativistic_2013}
\begin{equation}
h_{\mu\nu} \equiv g_{\mu\nu} + u_\mu u_\nu,
\label{eq:projection_tensor}
\end{equation}
and the expansion scalar
\cite[eq. 3.13]{rezzolla_relativistic_2013}
\begin{equation}
\Theta \equiv h^{\mu\nu} \nabla_\nu u_\mu = \nabla_\mu u^\mu.
\end{equation}
Inserting these to eq. \ref{eq:ep_conservation} results in
\begin{equation}
\nabla_\mu T^{\mu \lambda} = u^\lambda u^\mu \nabla_\mu (\rho h) + \rho h u^\mu \nabla_\mu u^\lambda + \rho h \Theta u^\lambda + g^{\lambda\mu} \nabla_\mu p,
\end{equation}
where $h$ is the specific enthalpy of eq. \ref{eq:specific_enthalpy}.
Relativistic acceleration is defined as
\begin{equation}
a_\nu = u^\mu \nabla_\mu u_\nu.
\end{equation}
It is orthogonal to the velocity, and therefore
\begin{equation}
a^\mu u_\mu = 0.
\end{equation}
Projecting using eq. \ref{eq:ep_conservation} and using these we get
\cite[eq. 3.54]{rezzolla_relativistic_2013}
\begin{equation}
\bm{h} \cdot \bm{\nabla} \cdot \bm{T}
= h^\nu_\lambda \nabla_\mu T^{\mu \lambda}
= \rho h u^\mu \nabla_\mu u^\nu + h^\nu_\lambda g^{\lambda\mu} \nabla_\mu p
= 0.
\end{equation}
Dividing by $\rho h$ we get the \textbf{relativistic Euler equations}
\cite[eq. 3.55]{rezzolla_relativistic_2013}
\begin{equation}
u^\mu \nabla_\mu u_\nu + \frac{1}{\rho h} h^\mu_\nu \nabla_\mu p = 0.
\end{equation}
Similarly we can project along the direction of velocity,
\begin{equation}
\bm{u} \cdot \bm{\nabla} \cdot \bm{T} = u_\lambda \nabla_\mu T^{\mu\lambda} = 0.
\end{equation}
This results in the \textbf{energy-conservation equation}
\cite[eq. 3.57]{rezzolla_relativistic_2013}
\begin{equation}
u^\mu \nabla_\mu e + \rho h \theta = 0.
\end{equation}
For a one-dimensional flow in Cartesian coordinates these can be rewritten as
\cite[eq. 4.79-4.80]{rezzolla_relativistic_2013}
\todo{Prove this}
\begin{align}
\partial_t \left[ (e+pv^2) \gamma^2 \right] + \partial_x \left[ (e+p) \gamma^2 v \right] &= 0 \\
\partial_t \left[ (e+p) \gamma^2 v \right] + \partial_x \left[ (ev^2 + p) \gamma^2 \right] &= 0.
\end{align}
\todo{Perturb these to get the speed of sound}
The speed of sound is defined as
\cites[eq. 2.168]{rezzolla_relativistic_2013}[eq. 13]{giese_2020}[eq. 3]{giese_2021}
\begin{align}
c_s^2
&\equiv \frac{dp}{de} \\
&= \frac{dp/dT}{de/dT}
\end{align}
For an ultrarelativistic plasma $c_s^2=\frac{1}{3}$.
\todo{Write here why}


\section{Field-fluid system}
Based on \cite{moore_pt_1995}.

In the electroweak phase transition the fluid is coupled to a scalar field with the energy-momentum tensor
\cites[eq. 2.9]{hindmarsh_gw_pt_2019}
\begin{equation}
T_\phi^{\mu \nu}
= \partial^\mu \partial^\nu \phi
- g^{\mu \nu} \left(\frac{1}{2} (\partial \phi)^2 + V_0 (\phi) \right)
\end{equation}

The total energy-momentum is conserved,
\cite[eq. 5.17]{lecture_notes}
\begin{equation}
\partial_\mu T^{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu (T_f^{\mu \nu} + T_\phi^{\mu \nu}) = 0.
\label{eq:ep_conservation}
\end{equation}


\section{Relativistic combustion}
This chapter of the lecture notes is largely based on the references
% According to Hindmarsh, abbreviating "references" as "refs" is OK in the thesis.
\cites{hindmarsh_gw_pt_2019}{espinosa_energy_2010}.
\todo{Add more content from \cite[ch. 6]{mazumdar_review_2019}.}

If the wall velocity is constant, eq. \ref{eq:ep_conservation} also holds in the wall frame.
Therefore for a wall moving in the z-direction
\cite[eq. 7]{espinosa_energy_2010}
\begin{equation}
\partial_z T^{zz} = \partial_z T^{z0} = 0.
\end{equation}
Inserting the definition of $T$ from eq. \ref{eq:ep_tensor} results in the bubble wall junction conditions
\cites[eq. 7.22]{lecture_notes}[eq. B.2-3]{hindmarsh_gw_pt_2019}
% This is almost trivial.
\begin{align}
w_- \tilde{\gamma}_-^2 \tilde{v}_- &= w_+ \tilde{\gamma}_+^2 \tilde{v}_+, \\
w_- \tilde{\gamma}_-^2 \tilde{v}_-^2 + p_- &= w_+ \tilde{\gamma}_+^2 \tilde{v}_+^2 + p_+
\end{align}
These can be rearranged as
\cites[eq. 7.32]{lecture_notes}[eq. 6-7]{giese_2020}
\todo{How to prove this step? My attempts of manual proof have failed.}
\begin{align}
\tilde{v}_+ \tilde{v}_- = \frac{p_+ - p_-}{e_+ - e_-} \\
\frac{\tilde{v}_+}{\tilde{v}_-} = \frac{e_- + p_+}{e_+ + p_-}
\label{eq:junction_ep}
\end{align}
Further simplification of these requires additional definitions
that we will now introduce.

The trace of the energy-momentum tensor of equation \ref{eq:ep_tensor} is
\begin{align}
\text{tr} (T^{\mu \nu})
&= T^\mu_\mu \\
&= g_{\mu \nu} T^{\mu \nu} \\
&=3p - e
\end{align}
We can quantify its difference from zero with the trace anomaly
\cites[eq. 7.24]{lecture_notes}[eq. 28]{giese_2020}
\begin{equation}
\theta = \frac{1}{4}(e-3p).
\end{equation}
The definition of the trace anomaly varies by a factor of $\frac{1}{4}$ depending on the source as a matter of convention.
The difference of the trace anomalies just ahead and behind of the wall is denoted as
\begin{align}
\Delta \theta
&\equiv \theta_+ - \theta_- \\
&= \theta_s - \theta_b
\end{align}
With this we can define the transition strength
\begin{equation}
\alpha_+ = \frac{4 \Delta \theta}{3 w_+}.
\end{equation}
We can also define the enthalpy ratio
\begin{equation}
r = \frac{w_+}{w_-}.
\end{equation}
With these definitions the junction conditions of eq. \ref{eq:junction_ep} can be simplified as
\begin{equation}
\tilde{v}_+ \tilde{v}_- = \frac{1-(1-3\alpha_+)r}{3-3(1+\alpha_+)r},
\quad
\frac{\tilde{v}_+}{\tilde{v}_-} = \frac{3+(1-3\alpha_+)r}{1+3(1+\alpha_+)r}.
\end{equation}
This is the easiest to prove in the reverse direction.
To further get expressions for $\tilde{v}_+$ and $\tilde{v}_-$ that are independent of $r$, we can extract $r$ from both equations and mark those as equal, resulting in the equation
\begin{equation}
\left( \frac{1}{\tilde{v}_-} + 3 \tilde{v}_- \right) v_+ - 3(1+\alpha_+)v_+^2 = \alpha_+ - 1.
\end{equation}
% Derivation: Mathematica Eliminate[] and a bit of simplification.
This is of second order in both $\tilde{v}_+$ and $\tilde{v}_-$ and can be solved as \cite[eq. B.6, B.7]{hindmarsh_gw_pt_2019}
\begin{align}
\tilde{v}_+ &= \frac{1}{2(1+\alpha_+)}\left[ \left(\frac{1}{3\tilde{v}_-}+\tilde{v}_-\right) \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{3\tilde{v}_-} - \tilde{v}_- \right)^2 + 4\alpha_+^2 + \frac{8}{3} \alpha_+} \right]
\label{eq:v_tilde_plus}
\\
\tilde{v}_- &= \frac{1}{2} \left[ \left( (1+\alpha_+)\tilde{v}_+ + \frac{1-3\alpha_+}{3\tilde{v}_+} \right) \pm \sqrt{\left((1+\alpha_+)\tilde{v}_+ + \frac{1-3\alpha_+}{3\tilde{v}_+} \right)^2 - \frac{4}{3}} \right)
\label{eq:v_tilde_minus}
\end{align}
Both of these are basic second-order solutions, but in \ref{eq:v_tilde_plus} the discriminant has been simplified.



We can obtain useful continuity equations from the conservation of energy-momentum.
We start by defining two vectors, the fluid 4-velocity
\begin{equation}
u^\mu = \gamma(-1, \overrightarrow{v})^\mu
\end{equation}
and its orthonormal vector
\begin{equation}
\bar{u}^\mu = \gamma(-v, \frac{\overrightarrow{v}}{v})^\mu.
\end{equation}
These form an orthonormal basis.
It should be noted, that for orthonormal vectors
\begin{align}
% Note that the lecture notes use ubar here.
u_\mu u^\mu &= -1, \\
u_\mu \bar{u}^\mu &= 0.
\end{align}
By projecting the conservation equation to this basis we get
\begin{align}
0 = u_\mu \partial_\nu T^{\mu \nu} = -\partial_\mu (w u^\mu) + u^\mu \partial_\mu p \\
0 = \bar{u} \partial_\nu T^{\mu \nu} = w \bar{u}^\nu u^\mu \partial_\mu u_\nu + \bar{u}^\mu \partial_\mu p
\end{align}

Dimensionless coordinate
\begin{equation}
\xi = \frac{r}{t}
\end{equation}

Hydrodynamic equations, aka. continuity equations
\todo{Todo: Derive these}
\cites[eq. 7.30-7.31]{lecture_notes}[eq. 5]{giese_2021}
\begin{align}
\frac{dv}{d\xi} &= \frac{2v(1-v^2)}{\xi(1-v\xi)} \left( \frac{\mu(\xi,v)^2}{c_s^2} - 1 \right)^{-1} \\
\frac{dw}{d\xi} &= w \left( 1 + \frac{1}{c_s^2} \right) \gamma^2 \mu(\xi,v) \frac{dv}{d\xi}
\end{align}

It should be highlighted that everything in this chapter is independent of the equation of state introduced in the next chapter.


\section{The bag model}
The equation of state is the function $p(T)$ or $p(w)$ that characterises the behaviour of the fluid as a function of temperature $T$ or enthalpy $w$.
One of the simplest equations of state is the bag model, where
\cites[eq. 7.33]{lecture_notes}[eq. 8-9]{giese_2020}
\begin{align}
p_s &= a_s T^4 - V_s
\label{eq:bag_ps} \\
p_b &= a_b T^4,
\label{eq:bag_pb}
\end{align}
where $a_s$, $a_b$ and $V_s$ are positive constants with $a_s > a_b$.
s=symmetric, b=broken.

In this model the speed of sound simplifies as
\begin{equation}
c_s^2 = \frac{dp}{de} = 1/3,
\end{equation}
This corresponds to assuming the bth phases to be ultrarelativistic.

The name of the bag model originates from quantum chromodynamics (QCD), where it's used to describe the proton as a bag of quarks.
\todo{check this}


\section{More complex models}
The bag model includes severe approximations, and for realistic simulations a more complex model is needed.
The primary parameters for these models are
\begin{itemize}
    \item The phase transition parameters: percolation temperature, phase transition duration
    \item Bubble wall velocity
    \item Fraction of energy that is converted into fluid motion: $\kappa$
    \item Numerical prefactor from lattice simulations
\end{itemize}

Speed of sound may not be ultrarelativistic, especially in the broken phase.

\subsection{The constant sound speed model}
The constant sound speed model, also known as the $\mu, \nu$ model, expands the bag model by allowing a change in the speed of sound of the broken phase.
\cites[eq. 15]{giese_2021}[eq. 38]{giese_2020}
\begin{align}
p_s &= \frac{1}{3} a_+ T^\mu - \epsilon \\
p_b &= \frac{1}{3} a_- T^\nu \\
e_s &= a_+ T^\mu + \epsilon \\
e_b &= \frac{1}{3} a_- (\nu - 1) T^\nu
\end{align}
The parameters $a_+$ and $a_-$ are proportional to the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the symmetric and broken phases, and $\epsilon$ is the temperature-independent vacuum energy that is released in the phase transition.
The parameters $\mu$ and $\nu$ are determined by the sound speeds in the symmetric and broken phases:
\cites[eq. 16]{giese_2021}[eq. 39]{giese_2020}
\begin{align}
\mu = 1 + \frac{1}{c_{s,s}^2}, \\
\nu = 1 + \frac{1}{c_{s,b}^2}.
\end{align}
\footnote{Please note that there is a typo in \cite[eq. 15]{giese_2021}. There the 4 should be a $\mu$.}

\subsection{Model with cubic thermal effects}
Free energy
\todo{Where does this come from? How to extract the thermal effects?}
\cite[eq. 45]{giese_2020}
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\textsc{F}(\phi, T) =
&- \frac{a_+}{3} T^4 \\
&+ \lambda \left( \phi^4 - 2E\phi^3 T + \phi^2 \left( E^2 T_\text{cr}^2 + c \left( T^2 - T_\text{cr}^2 \right) \right) \right) \\
&+ \frac{\lambda}{4} \left( c - E^2 \right)^2 T_\text{cr}^4
\end{split}
\end{align}

The minimum of the field potential is given by
\cite[eq. 46]{giese_2020}
\begin{equation}
\phi_\text{min} = \frac{3}{4} ET + \sqrt{\frac{T^2}{2}(\frac{9}{8}E^2 - c) - \frac{T_\text{cr}^2}{2} (E^2 - c)}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Model with a two-step phase transition}
Two scalar fields and two symmetry breakings. Examples: electroweak symmetry, $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry.
Cubic term is neglected.
Pressures are of the form
\cite[eq. 47-48]{giese_2020}
\begin{align}
p_s(T) = \frac{1}{3}a_+ T^4 + (b_+ - c_+ T^2)^2 - b_-^2 \\
p_b(T) = \frac{1}{3}a_+ T^4 + (b_- - c_-T^2)^2 - b_-^2
\end{align}
Compare these to the equations \ref{eq:bag_ps}, \ref{eq:bag_pb}.

\section{Energy redistribution}
Efficiency factor $\kappa$, which is the fraction of energy that is converted into fluid motion.
\begin{equation}
\kappa = \frac{3}{\xi_w^3 \Delta \theta} \int d\xi \xi^2 w \gamma^2 v^2
\end{equation}
From solving the hydrodynamic equations of state of a single expanding bubble.

Kinetic energy fraction
\cites[eq. 7.36]{lecture_notes}[eq. 5]{giese_2020}
\begin{align}
K
&= \frac{\rho_\text{fl}}{\bar{e}}
&= \frac{1}{\mathcal{v} \bar{e}} \int d^3 x w \gamma^2 v^2,
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{v}$ is the volume we average over, and $\bar{e}$ is the mean energy density.
It should be noted that $0 < K < 1$.
\cite{giese_2020}

For a single bubble we have, using its volume and the energy density of the symmetric phase that the bubble replaces, the kinetic energy fraction
\cites[eq. 7.37]{lecture_notes}[eq. 5]{giese_2020}
\begin{equation}
K_1 = \frac{3}{\xi_w^3 e_s} \int d\xi \xi^2 w \gamma^2 v^2.
\end{equation}

The kinetic energy fraction can be determined from
\begin{itemize}
\item wall velocity $v_w$
\item the speeds of sound
\item strength parameter of the phase transition
\end{itemize}

Let us define the pseudotrace as
\cites[eq. 34]{giese_2020}[eq. 1]{giese_2021}
\begin{equation}
\overline{\theta} \equiv e - \frac{p}{c_{s,b}^2}.
\end{equation}

For detonations, the optimal phase transition strength is
\cites[eq. 34]{giese_2020}[eq. 1]{giese_2021}
\todo{Todo: Explain how this is defined}
