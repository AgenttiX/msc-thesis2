We extend this analysis and give the equation of state in 2+1+1+1 flavour {QCD}. In order to describe the evolution of the universe from temperatures several hundreds of {GeV} to several tens of {MeV} we also include the known effects of the electroweak theory and give the effective degree of freedoms. As another application of lattice {QCD} we calculate the topological susceptibility (chi) up to the few {GeV} temperature region. These two results, {EoS} and chi, can be used to predict the dark matter axion's mass in the post-inflation scenario and/or give the relationship between the axion's mass and the universal axionic angle, which acts as a initial condition of our universe.},

The observatory will be based on three arms with six active laser links, between three identical spacecraft in a triangular formation separated by 2.5 million km. LISA is an all-sky monitor and will offer a wide view of a dynamic cosmos using Gravitational Waves as new and unique messengers to unveil The Gravitational Universe. It provides the closest ever view of the infant Universe at TeV energy scales, has known sources in the form of verification binaries in the Milky Way, and can probe the entire Universe, from its smallest scales near the horizons of black holes, all the way to cosmological scales. The LISA mission will scan the entire sky as it follows behind the Earth in its orbit, obtaining both polarisations of the Gravitational Waves simultaneously, and will measure source parameters with astrophysically relevant sensitivity in a band from below \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}{\textbackslash},\$Hz to above \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},\$Hz.},

	doi = {10.48550/ARXIV.2308.12943},
	abstract = {We compute the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum sourced by sound waves produced during a first-order phase transition in the radiation-dominated epoch. The correlator of the velocity field is evaluated in accordance with the sound shell model. In our derivation we include the effects of the expansion of the Universe, which are relevant in particular for sourcing processes whose time duration is comparable with the Hubble time. Our results show a causal growth at small frequencies, \$Ω\_\{{\textbackslash}rm GW\} {\textbackslash}sim k{\textasciicircum}3\$, possibly followed by a linear regime \$Ω\_\{{\textbackslash}rm GW\} {\textbackslash}sim k\$ at intermediate \$k\$, depending on the phase transition parameters. Around the peak, we find a steep growth that approaches the \$k{\textasciicircum}9\$ scaling found within the sound shell model. The resulting bump around the peak of the GW spectrum may represent a distinctive feature of GWs produced from acoustic motion. Nothing similar has been observed for vortical (magneto)hydrodynamic turbulence. Nevertheless, we find that the \$k{\textasciicircum}9\$ scaling is less extended than expected in the literature, and it does not necessarily appear. The dependence on the duration of the source, \$δτ\_\{{\textbackslash}rm fin\}\$, is quadratic at small frequencies \$k\$, and proportional to \${\textbackslash}ln{\textasciicircum}2 (1 + δτ\_\{{\textbackslash}rm fin\} H\_*)\$ for an expanding Universe. At frequencies around the peak, the growth is suppressed by a factor \$Υ= 1 - 1/(1 + δτ\_\{{\textbackslash}rm fin\} \{H\}\_*)\$ that becomes linear when the GW source is short. We discuss in which cases the dependence on the source duration is linear or quadratic for stationary processes. This affects the amplitude of the GW spectrum, both in the causality tail and at the peak, showing that the assumption of stationarity is a very relevant one, as far as the GW spectral shape is concerned. Finally, we present a general semi-analytical template of the resulting GW spectrum, as a function of the parameters of the phase transition.},

	abstract = {Future space-based interferometers offer an unprecedented opportunity to detect signals from the stochastic gravitational wave background originating from a first-order phase transition at the electroweak scale. The phase transition is accompanied by a change of the equation of state from that of pure radiation. In this work we study the effect of this change on the power spectrum of gravitational waves generated by the sound waves in the plasma during the acoustic phase of the transition. We carry out an analytic calculation assuming that the sound speed and the fluid shear-stress that sources tensor perturbations remain approximately constant during the acoustic phase. The effect of a softer equation of state is twofold: (i) a scale-independent suppression of the power spectrum at all scales, due to the modified propagation of both sound and gravitational waves and (ii) the peak of the spectrum moves to smaller frequencies as the equation of state becomes softer. The power-law indices of the spectrum at small and large scales are unaffected by the softening of the equation of state. Our work improves the current estimation of the gravitational waves power spectrum from first order phase transitions and expands the possible scenarios of transitions that can be tested by gravitational wave detectors.},

	abstract = {We calculate the gravitational wave spectrum generated by sound waves during a cosmological phase transition, incorporating several advancements beyond the current state-of-the-art. Rather than relying on the bag model or similar approximations, we derive the equation of state directly from the effective potential. This approach enables us to accurately determine the hydrodynamic quantities, which serve as initial conditions in a generalised hybrid simulation. This simulation tracks the fluid evolution after bubble collisions, leading to the generation of gravitational waves. Our work is the first self-consistent numerical calculation of gravitational waves for the real singlet extension of the standard model. Our computational method is adaptable to any particle physics model, offering a fast and reliable way to calculate gravitational waves generated by sound waves. With fewer approximations, our approach provides a robust foundation for precise gravitational wave calculations and allows for the exploration of model-independent features of gravitational waves from phase transitions.},
