@article{borsanyi_lattice_2016,
	title = {Lattice {QCD} for Cosmology},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07494},
	abstract = {We present a full result for the equation of state ({EoS}) in 2+1+1 (up/down, strange and charm quarks are present) flavour lattice {QCD}. We extend this analysis and give the equation of state in 2+1+1+1 flavour {QCD}. In order to describe the evolution of the universe from temperatures several hundreds of {GeV} to several tens of {MeV} we also include the known effects of the electroweak theory and give the effective degree of freedoms. As another application of lattice {QCD} we calculate the topological susceptibility (chi) up to the few {GeV} temperature region. These two results, {EoS} and chi, can be used to predict the dark matter axion's mass in the post-inflation scenario and/or give the relationship between the axion's mass and the universal axionic angle, which acts as a initial condition of our universe.},
