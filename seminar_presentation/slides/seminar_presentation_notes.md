Welcome
Equations of state for phase transitions in the early universe
Mika MÃ¤ki

## Outline
- Introduction to the topic
- Hydrodynamics: the math

## Timeline of the Big Bang
- Planck epoch
    - Not much can be said
    - Theory of quantum gravity needed: gravity is non-renormalizable so QFT breaks down
- Grand unification epoch
    - Grand unified theories
    - SM forces become unified under a single gauge group
- Inflation
    - Temperature scale depends on the model
- EW transition
    - Our scale of interest
    - "Particle masses switched on"
    - Weak and EM interaction separate
- QCD transition
    - QCD coupling increases
    - Free quark-gluon plasma becomes bound hadrons
- Big bang nucleosynthesis
    - Most of H and He produced
- Recombination
    - Electrons and protons combine to form atoms
    - Everything before is inaccessible to EM telescopes
- Summary
    - Epochs before EW transition
    - Epochs after EW transition are relatively well known
    - EW transition: window to new physics

## Higgs mechanism
- Qualitative description here
    - Details are worth another lecture
- Initially no rest masses: Higgs field at zero
- Temperature lowered: potential changes
- Energetically optimal to have non-zero value
- Math
    - If zero expectation value: vertex term for perturbations
    - If non-zero: rest mass + vertex
- If there is a kink in the potential
    - Wall separating the phases
    - First-order phase transition

## Extensions
- SM is highly successful but incomplete
- EW hierarcy problem
    - Perturbative corrections to the Higgs mass -> Planck scale
- Baryogenesis
    - SM has sources of CP and therefore baryon number violation, but not sufficient
- Examples
    - ...
    - Dark sectors: coupled only to gravity -> detectable by GWs
    - But energy scale may differ
- Critical point
    - SM: 80 GeV but Higgs is 125 GeV -> crossover
    - Extensions raise the critical point

## First-order phase transitions
- Spontaneous bubble nucleation: quantum fluctuations
- Sharp boundary (recall the Higgs potential)
- Unlike a kettle: temperature decreases
- Sound of a kettle tells the properties of water (or other liquid)
    - Decalcifier pills
    - Different sound
- Video
    - Spontaneous nucleation
    - Constant wall speed
    - Temperature decreases -> Nucleation rate increased
    - Bubble collisions
    - Remains of bubbles after the transition -> sound shells -> GWs
    - Spherical symmetry -> no direct GW production from bubbles, but instead from sound waves
    - Collisions also produce GWs

## Gravitational waves
- Early universe transparent, unlike EM
- ...
- LISA
    - lasers: relative distance -> phase

## Relativistic hydrodynamics
- ...
- Energy-momentum tensor
    - energy density, pressure, momentum, shear stresses...
    - 4-by-4 matrix

## Key parameters
- Nucleation temperature: energy scale of the transition
- Transition strength: relative change of energy density and pressure
- Wall speed is constant due to friction
- Transition rate: inverse of the duration of the transition
- Start from simple

## Relativistic combustion
- Conservation of energy & momentum
- Example: hybrid (supersonic deflagration)
- Universe frame
    - Greater pressure inside: expanding plasma
    - One of the velocities can be zero
- Wall frame
    - Plasma flowing in through the wall
    - Both either sub- or supersonic

## Types of relativistic combustion
- Subsonic deflagration
    - Fluid movement outside the bubble
- Supersonic deflagration (hybrid)
    - Fluid movement on both sides
- Detonation
    - cJ: Chapman-Jouguet speed, a limit for v+

## Bag model
- Equation of state: pressure
- Higgs potential -> kinetic energy
- a constant
- T^4
- Basic thermodynamics
    - pressure -> enthalpy -> energy density & entropy density
- Origin of name: TODO

## Profiles
- x-axis: rescaled distance, dimensionless (self-similar)
- fluid velocity by distance from center
- Deflagration
    - bubble wall
    - decreasing velocity outside
    - Height of peak given by the junction conditions!
- Hybrid
    - Minimum radius for stationary fluid
    - TODO tell about mu
    - Reaching the maximum -> junction conditions -> outside
    - Integration to the shock outside the bubble
- Detonation
    - Movement inside the bubble
- Integration starts from the peak
    - If we were to start from the fixed points, we could end up in any solution
- Enthalpy
    - Outside: 1 (T=Tn)
